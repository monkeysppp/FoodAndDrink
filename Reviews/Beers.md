| 6X                        | 4* | This is what you're thinking of when you think of beer |
| Abbot Ale                 | 3* | Kinda generic ale but a bit off, like past its "best before" date |
| Adnam's Broadside         | 3* | Yet another malty ale, only this one's tangy!? |
| Adnam's Ghost Ship        | 4* | Kinda fruity, kinda ale-y, rather nice |
| Bishops Fingers           | 4* | Kinda fruity and inoffensive |
| Black Sheep               | 4* | Caramelly and malty |
| The Cranborne Poacher     | 4* | Classic stouty ale |
| Doombar                   | 5* | A bit like a wheat beer shandy; not at all unpleasant |
| Duvel                     | 5* | Very nice, smooth and fruity |
| Fuller's 1845             | 3* | Pretty pretty pretty good |
| Fuller's ESB              | 4* | A yardstick for a classic ale |
| Furtsy Ferret             | 3* | Malty and pleasant, but not much there |
| Guinness Foreign Extra    | 4* | Like Guinness but fruity |
| Guinness Rye Ale          | 3* | Variable, gassy, acrid |
| Hobgoblin                 | 4* | Creamy and rich/smooth |
| Hobgoblin Gold            | 4* | Not sure how to describe the taste but it's really nice |
| Hopping Hare              | 3* | Hang on, that's a lager |
| IPA Gold                  | 3* | Like the most awesome ale, but with the awesome removed leaving just the echo |
| King Goblin               | 3* | Fruity, nice but nothing special |
| Newcastle Brown           | 3* | Kinda bland ale |
| Old Peculiar              | 5* | Jesus that's smooth!  It's what you wish Guinness was |
| Old Tom                   | 3* | Fruity and Malty, just a bit uninspiring |
| Reinbacher Weissbier      | 3* | Both flat and bubbly!?  Tastes like Hoegaarden |
| Ringwood Forty Niner      | 3* | 's alright. Kinda forgettable but pleasantly "ale" enough |
| Shipyard IPA              | 3* | Inoffensive... mostly harmless |
| Spitfire                  | 3* | Clean and uninspiring, but an aftertaste of a perfect real ale |
| Spitfire Gold             | 4* | Kinda classic, kinda uninspiring but kinda nice "bitter" |
| Tangle Foot               | 2* | That's a lager, not a beer |
| Whitstable Bay            | 2* | Like an average lager shandy, only less so |
| Wiper & True (milk stout) | 4* | Definitely a milk stout, but a bit burnt |
