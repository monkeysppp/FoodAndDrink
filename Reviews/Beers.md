| Beer | Rating | Revie |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6X                        | ★★★★☆ | This is what you're thinking of when you think of beer |
| Abbot Ale                 | ★★★☆☆ | Kinda generic ale but a bit off, like past its "best before" date |
| Adnam's Broadside         | ★★★☆☆ | Yet another malty ale, only this one's tangy!? |
| Adnam's Ghost Ship        | ★★★★☆ | Kinda fruity, kinda ale-y, rather nice |
| Bacchus (Rasberry) Beers  | ★★★☆☆ | It's not unpleasant, just different.  It's kinda hard to explain, and then by the end you realise, it reminds you of cherry coke. |
| Bishops Fingers           | ★★★★☆ | Kinda fruity and inoffensive |
| Black Sheep               | ★★★★☆ | Caramelly and malty |
| The Blandford Fly         | ★★★☆☆ | Kinday fruity and meaty eith a bit of spice.  It actually tastes like a wheat beer to me |

| The Cranborne Poacher     | ★★★★☆ | Classic stouty ale |

| Fuller's 1845             | ★★★☆☆ | Pretty pretty pretty good |
| Fuller's ESB              | ★★★★☆ | A yardstick for a classic ale |
| Fuller's Honey  Dew       | ★★★☆☆ | A perfect balance between a lager and an ale, although why anyone would want that I'm not sure |
| Furtsy Ferret             | ★★★☆☆ | Malty and pleasant, but not much there |
| Guinness Foreign Extra    | ★★★★☆ | Like Guinness but fruity |
| Guinness Original.        | ★★★☆☆ | Like fizzy Marmite juice without the tang |
| Guinness Rye Ale          | ★★☆☆☆/<br>★★★★☆ | So variable.  When it's good it's smooth and creamy, but when it's bad it's gassy and acrid |
| Hobgoblin                 | ★★★★☆ | Creamy and rich/smooth |
| Hobgoblin Gold            | ★★☆☆☆/<br>★★★★☆ | Variable.  One time far too lagery, the other not sure how to describe the taste but it was really nice |
| Hogs Back TEA             | ★★★☆☆ | Just a generic ale |
| Hopping Hare              | ★★★☆☆ | Hang on, that's a lager |
| IPA Gold                  | ★★★☆☆ | Like the most awesome ale, but with the "awesome" removed, leaving just the echo |
| King Goblin               | ★★★☆☆ | Fruity, nice but nothing special |
| Newcastle Brown           | ★★★☆☆ | Kinda bland ale |
| Old Crafty Hen            | ★★★☆☆ | Like Old Speckled Hen but with a hint of the wooden floor in an old monastery |
| Old Peculiar              | ★★★★★ | Jesus that's smooth!  It's what you wish Guinness was |
| Old Speckled Hen          | ★★★★☆ | It's a classic |
| Old Tom                   | ★★★☆☆ | Fruity and Malty, just a bit uninspiring |
| Reinbacher Weissbier      | ★★★☆☆ | Both flat and bubbly!?  Tastes like Hoegaarden |
| Ringwood Forty Niner      | ★★★☆☆ | 's alright. Kinda forgettable but pleasantly "ale" enough |
| Shipyard IPA              | ★★★☆☆ | Inoffensive... mostly harmless |
| Spitfire                  | ★★★☆☆ | Clean and uninspiring, but an aftertaste of a perfect real ale |
| Spitfire Gold             | ★★★★☆ | Kinda classic, kinda uninspiring but kinda nice "bitter" |
| Tangle Foot               | ★★☆☆☆ | That's a lager, not a beer |
