# Chicken in BBQ Sauce

## Ingredients
- 8 small chicken joints
- olive oil
- freshly milled black pepper
- 1 medium onion, chopped small
### For the sauce
- 5 tablespoons dry cider (or wine)
- 5 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 heaped tablespoon tomato puree
- 1 heaped teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 heaped teaspoon mustard powder
- 1 fat clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon soft brown sugar

# Directions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200C.
1. Make sure the chicken joints are absolutely dry by patting them with kitchen paper, then rub each joint all over with
   olive oil and season with freshly milled pepper (but not salt).
1. Place the chicken into a shallow roasting tin, spreading the chopped onion in amongst them and sprinkling with a few
   drops of oil.
1. Place the tin on the highest shelf in the oven and let them cook for about 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile make up the barbecue sauce by whisking all the sauce ingredients together with a fork until blended
   thoroughly.
1. When the chicken has been cooking for 30 minutes, pour off any excess oil from the roasting tin, then pour the
   barbecue sauce over the chicken and cook for a further 25 minutes, basting frequently.
