# Lemon Drizzle Cake

## Ingredients
- 2 large eggs
- 175g (6oz) sugar
- 150g (5oz) soft butter or margarine
- grated zest of 1 lemon
- 175g (6oz) super-sifted self-raising flour
- 125ml (4floz) milk
- pinch of sea salt

- 150g (5oz) icing sugar
- 50ml (2floz) fresh lemon juice (about 1ï¿½ large lemons)

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
1. Line the bottom of a well-oiled 23 x 13 x 7.5cm loaf tin with grease proof paper.
1. Put the eggs and sugar in the bowl of the food processor and process for 2 minutes,scraping the sides down once with
   a rubber spatula.
1. Add spoonfuls of the soft butter or margarine on top of this mixture, together with the lemon zest, then pulse just
   until it disappears. The mixture should now resemble mayonnaise.
1. Add the flour, milk and salt, cover and pulse just until the mixture is smooth in texture and even in colour,
   scraping the sides down with a rubber spatula if necessary. Do not over-beat or the cake will be tough.
1. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown on top and firm to the touch.
1. Remove from the oven and stand the tin on a cooling rack.
1. To make the syrup, gently heat the sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan, stirring until a clear syrup is formed,
   about 3 minutes. Do not boil.
1. Prick the warm cake all over with a fork, then gently pour the syrup over it, until it has been completely absorbed.
1. Leave until cool, then carefully ease the cake from the baking tin and remove the baking paper.
