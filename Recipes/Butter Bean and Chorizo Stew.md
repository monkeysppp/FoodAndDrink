# Butter Bean and Chorizo Stew

For two

## Ingredients
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 heaped teaspoon paprika
- 1 heaped teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground fenugreek
- Black pepper to taste
- 1 tin chopped tomatoes
- 1 Stock cube
- Tin of butter beans
- Chorizo - raw, diced, about 100-150g

## Directions
1. Heat some oil and fry the onion until *properly* soft, adding water if needed to keep it from drying out.
2. Add garlic and fry a few mins more, then add paprika, oregano, fenugreek and ground black pepper.
3. Fry briefly with the herb/spices, then add the stock with a cup or so of water to dissolve it.
4. Add the tomatoes, bring to the boil and simmer at least 30 min.  Taste & season.

*At this point it can be frozen for later use (if you made more than you needed).*

5. Add butter beans, simmer until they are soft; 5-10 mins at most.
6. Fry chorizo separately, then add to the main dish.
7. Serve with ciabatta or other bread, or dumplings, maybe pasta/rice.

You can also add butter, cream and/or sugar, but this is usually a sign that the onion wasn't slow-cooked enough.
