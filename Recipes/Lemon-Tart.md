# Lemon Tart

## Ingredients
- ~300g shortcrust pastry
- Grated zest and juice from 3 lemons
- 100g caster sugar
- 2 eggs, plus 2 more egg yokes
- 150ml double cream

## Directions
1. Roll the pastry out then line a ~20cm flan tin.  If the flan tin does not have a loose bottom then you should line it with baking paper.  Prick the base of the pastry all over with a fork, then line the base with more baking paper and baking beans (maybe use rice if you don't have any).
2. Put the base in the oven at 180C for 10 minutes.  Remove the baking beans, then return to the oven for 10 minutes, making sure that the base is well baked.  When done, reduce the oven to 150C.
3. Whisk together the sugar, eggs and lemon zest.  Whisk in the lemon juice, then the double cream.  Leave to stand for 10 minutes.
4. Pour the lemon mix into the base, then _carefully_ (it'll be heavy and unstable!) transfer the tart to the oven and bake for 40 minutes, or until the filling is just set.  Leave to cool in the tin, then remove.
