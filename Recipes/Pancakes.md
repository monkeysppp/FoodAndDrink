# Pancakes

## Ingredients
- 110g plain flour, sifted
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs
- 200ml milk mixed with 75ml water
- 50g butter

## Directions
1. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl
   so the flour gets an airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the
   eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs- any sort of whisk or even a fork will do -
   incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.
1. Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking
   (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all
   the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour
   from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth,
   with the consistency of thin cream.
1. Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk
   it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of
   kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake.
