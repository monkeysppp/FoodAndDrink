## Ingredients
- Grapes!

**Make sure you're wearing some old clothes you don't mind getting stained**

## Directions
1. Pick a bunch of grapes off the vine, selecting out the ripe grapes and dump the rest
1. Put the grapes in a large pan and mash with a masher
1. Heat until the mix starts simmering, then hold at that temp for 10 minutes
1. Strain the juice through cheese cloth. Leave to stand for an hour, then repeat, then leave over night and strain again
1. Can be stored in the fridge for a week or two, but don't freeze it or it'll ruin the flavour
