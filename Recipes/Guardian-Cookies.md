From a Guardian article

# Ingredients
- 120g salted butter, at room temperature
- 75g light brown sugar
- 75g granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 140g plain flour
- 100g Strong white bread flour
- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 packs of Smarties

## Directions
1. Use a food mixer to beat together the butter and sugars until just combined. Add the vanilla extract, then the egg,
   and beat in well.
1. Sift together the flour and bicarbonate of soda, then use a spoon to add to the mixture, stirring until it just comes
   together into a dough.
1. Fold in the Smarties, then chill overnight, or for up to 72 hours.
1. Preheat the oven to 180C. Line two baking trays with greaseproof paper, and divide the mixture into golf-ball sized
   rounds, spacing them well apart.
1. Bake for about 20 minutes (not fan assisted), until golden, but not browned.
1. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the tray for a couple of minutes, before moving to a wire rack to cool
   completely.
