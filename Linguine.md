> The recipe we'll be breaking down here is for a light, springy, and delicate fresh pasta that's as well-suited to
slicing into noodles as it is to making stuffed pastas, which require super-thin, pliable sheets of dough.

## Ingredients
For two people or one hungry me:
- 50g 00 flour
- 90g plain flour
- 3 eggs (1 whole egg, and 2 more egg yolks)
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions
### Dough Preparation
1. Make a pile of flour with a well in the middle.
1. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt.
1. Break 1 whole egg, and 2 more egg yolks in to the well.
1. Whisk the eggs, and gradually add flour to the mix until you have a wet sticky ball.
1. Fold the dough, folding in the flour, and turning 45 degrees each press.  Continue until the dough is firm and dry
1. Knead for about 10 minutes.  If it still feels tacky, add flour as you go
1. Wrap in plastic to keep moist. Rest for at least 15 minutes.  Ideally rest for an hour+ for a smooth texture.

### Making the Linguine
1. Cut the dough ball in half, then leave half in the plastic wrap.
1. Roll until the dough is about 10mm thick.
1. Send through the flat rollers on the widest setting three times.
1. Step down one setting and send through 3 times.  Repeat until you get to about setting 6.
1. Fold the ends of the sheet in, then fold in half.
1. Set the rollers to maximum again, and send through 3 times.
1. Work down to about setting 6.
1. Cut into 30cm length sections, and dust with flour
1. Send through the Linguine cutter, then hang on the drier.

### Cooking
1. Boil in water for 60-90 seconds.
